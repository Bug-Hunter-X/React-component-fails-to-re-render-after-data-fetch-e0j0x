# React Component Re-rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React where a component fails to re-render after fetching data.  The component successfully fetches data, but the UI doesn't reflect the update.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from an API using `fetch`. While the `data` state updates correctly, the component doesn't re-render to display the new data.  This is because the data might be changed outside of the react state update cycle.
